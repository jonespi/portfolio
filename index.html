            <p>Hello. My name is Jonathan. 👨🏻💻. 
                Currently, I am at a Student at Thinkful and work at Sprout Social providing technical support to over 25,000 customers worldwide. 
                Previously, I worked at Mercari, the first Japanese unicorn. After years of providing customer support for these 
                companies, I have decided to take the leap and continue my career as a Software Engineer. 
                I’m excited to finally build the the features that I have provided support for throughout my career.</p>
